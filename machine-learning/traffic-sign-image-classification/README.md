## Dataset Description

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:
- Single-image, multi-class classification problem
- More than 40 classes
- More than 50,000 images in total
- Large, lifelike database
